## Overview
`Git-Started` is a project that will help PowerShellers set up their Personal Development Environment in a consistent and repeatable manner. 

## Problem
Imagine... you sit down at a new computer. You want to do some development work, and you need a little more power  than the VSCode web editor. What if you could just type `iwr https://git-started.sh | iex` and have your exact configuration downloaded and installed. 

And as I type this, I think I'm just describing dev containers. But maybe this is better because it doesn't require Docker?
## Objectives
1. Install required software
	1. Winget
	2. PowerShell 7

	5. VS Code PowerShell Extension
2. Log into GitHub
